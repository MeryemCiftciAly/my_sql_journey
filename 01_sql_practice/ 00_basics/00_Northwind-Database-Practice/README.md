# 🧩 Northwind Database Practice

### Overview
This repository documents my end-to-end SQL learning and practice journey using the **Northwind dataset** — a classic relational database for business analytics.  
The goal is to strengthen my SQL fluency from foundational to intermediate and advanced levels, while applying real-world data analytics workflows.

Throughout this repository, I follow and adapt material from multiple tutorials and self-learning sources, but all analyses, queries, and insights are created, refined, and extended independently to demonstrate my own problem-solving and analytical thinking.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
- Build strong fluency in **PostgreSQL** and core SQL concepts.
- Apply SQL for real-world analytics scenarios (sales, products, customers, employees).
- Create a structured environment for ongoing learning and mini-projects.
- Demonstrate data-to-insight workflows connecting **SQL → Excel → Visualization** tools.

---

### 📊 Workflow and Tools

**1. SQL (PostgreSQL)**
- Querying, filtering, and aggregating data across 14 related tables  
- Exploring joins, subqueries, CTEs, and conditional logic  
- Cleaning, formatting, and preparing datasets for analysis  

**2. Excel**
- Exporting SQL query results to Excel  
- Applying business analytics techniques: PivotTables, formulas (VLOOKUP, INDEX/MATCH, IF, etc.), charts  
- Automating processes with VBA and macros  

**3. Visualization**
- Selected mini-projects visualized in **Tableau Public** or **Power BI** to present key insights and dashboards  

**4. Python (Optional Integration)**
- Connecting PostgreSQL with Python via SQLAlchemy or psycopg2  
- Performing lightweight transformations or automated exports

### 🚀 Learning Roadmap

1. **Foundations:** SELECT, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, WHERE, logical operators  
2. **Filtering & Aggregation:** GROUP BY, HAVING, COUNT, SUM, AVG  
3. **Joins & Relationships:** INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, UNION  
4. **Advanced Queries:** Subqueries, CTEs, CASE, functions  
5. **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and exporting results  
6. **Mini Projects:** Independent SQL analysis using the Northwind dataset  
7. **Excel & Visualization:** Turning SQL outputs into actionable insights

### 🧠 Purpose & Growth
This repository serves as both a **learning log** and **portfolio**.  
It reflects my continued commitment to mastering SQL and building full analytical workflows — from database querying to storytelling through visualization.
