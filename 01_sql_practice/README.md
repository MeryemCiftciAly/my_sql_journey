## 📊 01_SQL_Practice: My Structured Learning Path in PostgreSQL

### **📌 Purpose & Philosophy**

This repository serves as a transparent, public portfolio **documenting** my ongoing learning and skill development in **PostgreSQL**. While I have successfully obtained the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, my dedication to continuous, hands-on practice ensures that my skills remain current and robust.

This work demonstrates my commitment to **structured problem-solving, data integrity, and pipeline integration**—the core proficiencies of a successful Data Analyst.

### **🗺️ Repository Structure and Progression**

My learning methodology combines formal instruction with self-directed challenges. I follow structured sources (like Khan Academy) and supplement with practical tutorials from selected educators (such as Baraa Katib Salkini). Challenges derived from these sources are logged here, followed by a mini challenge and a full project using real-world datasets.

The repository is organized into progressive difficulty tiers to clearly illustrate skill advancement:

| Section | Focus Area | Example Concepts Covered |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/Basic` | Foundational Querying | `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, simple `GROUP BY` and constraints. |
| `/Intermediate` | Logic, Grouping, & Data Linking | `GROUP BY`, **`HAVING`**, `CASE` statements, and all types of **Joins**. |
| `/Advanced` | Efficiency and Large-Scale Solutions | Window Functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and Indexing. |

#### **File Naming Convention (Clarity and Traceability)**

To ensure clarity and make the learning path traceable, all query files follow a standard structure:

> **`[Order]_[Complexity]_[Concept]_[Version].sql`**
>
> *Example:* `02_basic_aggregation_1.sql`

### **🛠️ Key Skills Demonstrated**

The code and projects within this repository actively demonstrate the following technical proficiencies:

* **Continuous Learning:** A commitment to moving beyond certificate completion through dedicated, structured practice.
* **Complex Querying & Aggregation:** Expertise in filtering aggregated data (`HAVING`) and handling conditional logic (`CASE`).
* **Data Adaptability & Troubleshooting:** The ability to resolve schema and constraint issues when migrating between SQL dialects (MySQL → PostgreSQL). This shows an ability to **diagnose and adapt** to real-world data issues.
* **Relational Database Skills:** Actively learning to manage data across multiple tables using various **Join** types.

### **🔗 Project Showcase & Deliverables**

To provide an interactive experience and clearly showcase the final results of the coding and queries, projects utilize analysis notebooks:

* **Kaggle** and **Google Colab Notebooks:** These are used to run complex SQL queries, process the results (often using Python), and present findings through clear narratives and visualizations.
* **End-to-End Workflow:** This process demonstrates the full data analyst workflow, from data ingestion (SQL) to final business communication, and the ability to integrate SQL results into tools like **Python**, **Tableau**, or **Power BI**.
