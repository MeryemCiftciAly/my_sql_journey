## **Project Overview**
This project is an experiment in **Data Storytelling**. It demonstrates how analytical thinking can be applied to real-world goals:

* **Strategic Planning:** Negotiating "Christmas Pacts" to eliminate overhead and maximize gift-giving revenue.
* **Operational Tracking:** Managing candy production, neighborhood sales, and shipping logistics.
* **Data-Driven Answers:** Using SQL and Data Viz to answer the questions stakeholders (family) ask at the end of a project.

## **Resources & Mentors**
This project was built using skills gained from the incredible free resources provided by the data community. If you are on your own learning journey, I highly recommend:
* **Baraa Khatib Salkini (Data With Baraa)** – For practical data application.
* **Chandoo** – For excellence in Excel and Data Visualization.
* **SQLBolt** – For interactive SQL foundations.
* **Khan Academy** – For mathematical and data basics.

**Happy Holidays!** To my fellow data analysts in the job search: Hang in there, keep practicing, and trust your path. I wish everyone a wonderful 2026! ✨
