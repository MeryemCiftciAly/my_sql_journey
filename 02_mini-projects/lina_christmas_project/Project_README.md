## Happy Holidays -- 🎄 Lina's Christmas Project: My SQL & Python Data Analysis Skills Portfolio Piece 🎁

## Project Overview: Story Meets Data Analysis

This project is a complete data analysis pipeline built around a narrative: **Lina's entrepreneurial summer endeavor to earn enough money to buy Christmas gifts for her family.**

The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data skills, from data modeling and SQL querying to final presentation, all using accessible tools.


| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **SQL** | Core querying, aggregation, and budget analysis. |
| **SQLite** | Local, file-based database engine (no server installation required). |
| **DBeaver** | Professional, cross-platform SQL client used for development and testing. |
| **Python** (via Kaggle) | Integrating the final SQL queries for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and interactivity. |
| **Canva / HTML** | Story creation and visual engagement. |

## Data Model & Schema

The dataset consists of three tables derived from the story:

1.  **`CandySales`:** **Revenue** data (income from summer sales).
2.  **`GiftList`:** **Expense** data (cost of gifts purchased).
3.  **`Shipments`:** **Logistics** data (shipping costs and delivery status).

## Key SQL Techniques Demonstrated

This project queries includes:
* Aggregate functions (`SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`)
* Data grouping (`GROUP BY`) and ordering (`ORDER BY`)
* Data filtering (`WHERE`)
* **Complex JOINs** (`INNER / LEFT JOIN` for cross-table insights).
* **Intermediate Logic** using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and `CASE` statements to perform a full budget analysis.
