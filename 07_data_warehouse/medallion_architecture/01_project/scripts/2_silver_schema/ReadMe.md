## Silver Layer – Data Warehouse Project

In the Medallion architecture of a data warehouse, the Silver Layer is responsible for cleaning, transforming, and standardizing raw data from the Bronze Layer to prepare it for analytical processing in the Gold Layer.

#### Key Points:

#### The Bronze Layer remains untouched to preserve the original, raw data.

#### The Silver Layer processes and refines the data while ensuring consistency and quality.

#### The Gold Layer will use this cleaned data for reporting, analytics, and decision-making.

This separation ensures data integrity, traceability, and better performance when handling large datasets.
