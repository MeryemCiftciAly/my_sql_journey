## Apex-Core: Advanced SQL & Data Analytics Simulation ## <br>
### Project Overview: ### This repository contains a scenario-based simulation of a high-growth platform managing complex user accounts and transactional data. 
It serves as a daily practice environment for intermediate to advanced PostgreSQL queries, focusing on real-world operational challenges.

The Goal To solve business-critical problems using data-driven insights.
This project emphasizes Business Velocity which is the ability to provide accurate data solutions quickly by choosing the most efficient tool (SQL, Python, or Excel) for the task at hand.

**Core Competencies Demonstrated**

**Technical SQL Mastery:** Complex JOIN logic, Multi-level Aggregations, Window Functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

**Financial Data Integrity:** Developing logic for real-time balance projections, status flagging, and risk-mitigation reporting.

**Business Agility & Prioritization:** Successfully navigating simulated "high-urgency" requests and pivoting data focus based on shifting departmental priorities (Risk vs. Growth).

**End-to-End Data Storytelling:** Translating raw database records into actionable insights through targeted visualizations (Line/Bar charts) and executive summaries.
