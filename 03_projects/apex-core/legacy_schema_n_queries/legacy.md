## These queries were created to practice joins and filtering

### Objective: 
Initial SQL practice focusing on basic joins and filtering.

### Reason: 
The business shifted from Integer IDs to UUIDs to support global scaling and high-security standards, and the data model of the table shifted.
Therefore, these queries would run in a production environment with the underlying tables.
