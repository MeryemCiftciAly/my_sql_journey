## DML Statement

This projects does not utilize traditional SQL DML. The data was created using a python script to create a dynamic. interconnected business environment for a fictional company, Apex Core.

The goal was to produce a dataset that could be queried accross the following business domains:
Customer Success
Growth & Marketing
Operations
Risk & Compliance

Using a script-based approach instead of a DML load allowed me to create a dataset that represents the complex cases and business scenarios found in real-world production data.

Tools Used: Python(Faker/Pandas)to generate the data, PostgresSQL for quering and storing the data.
