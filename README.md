## 👋 Welcome
This repository documents my journey learning SQL — from foundational syntax to more advanced querying and warehouse design.

It contains both **practice files** that strengthen my skills through guided challenges, **and real-world project files** where I apply those skills to realistic business scenarios.

I’m actively practicing SQL through:
- Guided tutorials that reinforce core skills  
- Challenges that stretch my ability to solve problems  
- Real-world datasets that mimic on-the-job tasks  

The purpose is not only to learn, but to **showcase practical, transferable skills** that would be used in a real data analyst or data engineer role.

## Freelance Initiative

## Nuuraqlyz Analytics (pronounced: new-rack-lyz)
Alongside my full-time career, I’ve started building a **freelance practice** to work one-on-one with **individuals, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and startups**.  

These are the kinds of clients who often face unique data challenges — challenges that I can help solve using my growing skill set in SQL, Python, and data analytics.  

Freelancing gives me the opportunity to:
- Apply my skills in real-world, client-focused scenarios  
- Solve problems that I might not encounter in a traditional role  
- Deliver value directly to people building their own ventures

## Why This Matters
There’s often little difference between someone learning SQL in university and someone doing so independently — except for **how the skills are applied**.

In my case, I’ve chosen to learn through doing:  
- Using industry tools  
- Solving real problems  
- Documenting the process publicly  

This repo is updated regularly as I continue building stronger fluency and confidence in SQL.
