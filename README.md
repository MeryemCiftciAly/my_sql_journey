## 👋 Welcome
This repository documents my journey learning SQL — from foundational syntax to more advanced querying and warehouse design.

It contains both **practice files** that strengthen my skills through guided challenges, **and real-world project files** where I apply those skills to realistic business scenarios.

I’m actively practicing SQL through:
- Guided tutorials that reinforce core skills  
- Challenges that stretch my ability to solve problems  
- Real-world datasets that mimic on-the-job tasks  

The purpose is not only to learn, but to **showcase practical, transferable skills** that would be used in a real data analyst or data engineer role.

## Freelance Initiative

## Nuuraqlyz Analytics (pronounced: new-rack-lyz)
Alongside my full-time career, I’ve started building a **freelance practice** to work one-on-one with **individuals, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and startups**.  

These are the kinds of clients who often face unique data challenges — challenges that I can help solve using my growing skill set in SQL, Python, and data analytics.  

Freelancing gives me the opportunity to:
- Apply my skills in real-world, client-focused scenarios  
- Solve problems that I might not encounter in a traditional role  
- Deliver value directly to people building their own ventures

## Why This Matters
There’s often little difference between someone learning SQL in university and someone doing so independently — except for **how the skills are applied**.

In my case, I’ve chosen to learn through doing:  
- Using industry tools  
- Solving real problems  
- Documenting the process publicly  

This repo is updated regularly as I continue building stronger fluency and confidence in SQL.

## 🚀 Stay Tuned

💡 I also did a **data warehouse project** out of curiosity to see what I would learn.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The layout below is the **current and planned organization** for this repository.  
Some folders are in use now, while others are placeholders for future work as my SQL skillset grows into cloud engineering and automation.  
This structure may evolve over time to better fit active projects and workflow
