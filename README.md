## 👋 Welcome
This repository documents my journey learning SQL — from foundational syntax to more advanced querying and warehouse design.

It contains both **practice files** that strengthen my skills through guided challenges, **and real-world project files** where I apply those skills to realistic business scenarios.

I’m actively practicing SQL through:
- Guided tutorials that reinforce core skills  
- Challenges that stretch my ability to solve problems  
- Real-world datasets that mimic on-the-job tasks  

The purpose is not only to learn, but to **showcase practical, transferable skills** that would be used in a real data analyst or data engineer role.


### Why This Repository Matters

While I have completed the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**, I am a strong advocate for the power of self-learning. I believe that in data analytics, the true measure of skill lies not in a certificate, but in **how you apply your knowledge**. There's often little difference between someone with a university degree and someone who has learned independently, except for how they've proven their capabilities.

I've chosen to learn by doing, which means I:
* Use **industry-standard tools** to solve real-world problems.
* **Publicly document** my process to demonstrate my capabilities.

This hands-on approach has been instrumental in building my fluency and confidence.
