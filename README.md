## 👋 Welcome

This repository documents my journey learning SQL from foundational syntax to more advanced querying and warehouse design.

I’m actively practicing SQL through:

- ✅ **Guided tutorials** that reinforce core skills  
- 🧠 **Challenges** that stretch my ability to solve problems  
- 📂 **Real-world datasets** that mimic on-the-job tasks

The purpose is not only to learn, but to **showcase the practical, transferable skills** that would be used in a real data analyst or data engineer role.

## 📂 Repo Structure

- `basic/` – Filtering, sorting, aggregates, data types  
- `intermediate/` – Subqueries, joins, CTEs, set ops  
- `advanced/` – Window functions, optimization, warehouse logic  
- `projects/` – Case studies, data warehouse build (e.g. Medallion Method)

## 💡 Why This Matters

There’s often little difference between someone learning SQL in university and someone doing so independently — **except for how the skills are applied**.

In my case, I’ve chosen to learn through doing using **industry tools**, solving **real problems**, and documenting the process publicly.

This repo is updated regularly as I continue building stronger fluency and confidence in SQL.
