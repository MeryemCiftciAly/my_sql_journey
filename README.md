## 👋 Welcome
This repository documents my journey learning SQL — from foundational syntax to more advanced querying and warehouse design.

It contains both **practice files** that strengthen my skills through guided challenges, **and real-world project files** where I apply those skills to realistic business scenarios.

I’m actively practicing SQL through:
- Guided tutorials that reinforce core skills  
- Challenges that stretch my ability to solve problems  
- Real-world datasets that mimic on-the-job tasks  

The purpose is not only to learn, but to **showcase practical, transferable skills** that would be used in a real data analyst or data engineer role.

## Freelance Initiative

## About Nuuraqlyz Analytics (pronounced: new-rack-lyz)
**I’m actively seeking a full-time role, and in the meantime, I’ve established Nuuraqlyz Analytics as a way to practice and demonstrate my skills.** 
Through these independent projects, I’m gaining real-world experience with data challenges, using tools like SQL, R, Python, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau.  

**This work demonstrates my ability to deliver results in a professional, results-oriented environment.** 
It shows the value I can bring as a contributing member of a company's team, while also providing hands-on assistance to individuals and SMEs who are collaborating on data-driven decisions to achieve their objectives.

### **About Website:** This website serves as a further demonstration of my skills, as I built it myself using a combination of AI prompts, and my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.

## Why This Matters
There’s often little difference between someone learning SQL in university and someone doing so independently — except for **how the skills are applied**.

In my case, I’ve chosen to learn through doing:  
- Using industry tools  
- Solving real problems  
- Documenting the process publicly  

This repo is updated regularly as I continue building stronger fluency and confidence in SQL.

## 🚀 Stay Tuned

💡 I also did a **data warehouse project** out of curiosity to see what I would learn.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The layout below is the **current and planned organization** for this repository.  
Some folders are in use now, while others are placeholders for future work as my SQL skillset grows into cloud engineering and automation.  
This structure may evolve over time to better fit active projects and workflow.
