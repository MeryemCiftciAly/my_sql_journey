#International Sanctions Insights

---

## Overview
**International Sanctions Insights** is a data analysis project aimed at exploring the dynamics, effectiveness, and trends of sanctions between countries.  
Using a dataset provided by **Drexel University** and the **Austrian Institute of Economic Research**, this project applies **PostgreSQL** for data exploration and **Power BI** for visualization.  
The end result will be a **multi-page Power BI report** and an **interactive dashboard** answering core questions on the purpose, execution, and success rates of sanctions.

## Objectives
We aim to address the following themes:

1. **The Why** – Why sanctions are imposed (objectives and triggers).  
2. **The Who** – Which countries impose sanctions, and which are targeted.  
3. **The How** – The types, categories, and scope of sanctions.  
4. **The Outcome** – Measuring success, failure, and partial effectiveness.  
5. **The Effectiveness** – Identifying which sanctions work best and under what circumstances.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Load and clean the dataset in **PostgreSQL**.  
   - Normalize country names and sanction categories.  
   - Handle missing values and ensure data type consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Run SQL queries to detect trends, outliers, and relationships.  
   - Identify top sanctioning countries, most sanctioned states, and common objectives.

3. **Deep-Dive Analysis**  
   - Aggregate and calculate success rates by sanction type and objective.  
   - Explore correlations between objectives and outcomes.

4. **Visualization in Power BI**  
   - **Page 1:** Sanctions overview and KPIs.  
   - **Page 2:** Effectiveness analysis by type, country, and objective.  
   - **Page 3:** Timeline analysis and long-term impact.

5. **Dashboard Creation**  
   - Pin essential visuals for quick, high-level insights.  
   - Support KPIs with drill-through visuals for context.
