🗂️ NYC Sanitation Waste Analysis — Personal Project
📌 Project Overview
This project was inspired by a public dataset from the New York City Department of Sanitation, which tracks monthly waste tonnage across boroughs and waste types over several years. As I explored the dataset, several questions sparked my curiosity, and I decided to develop a full mini-project around it.

This project allowed me to combine SQL practice with storytelling, data exploration, and public presentation using tools like PowerPoint and Excel.

🎯 Objectives
Refine SQL skills by exploring and querying a real-world dataset using PostgreSQL and Kaggle.

Practice data storytelling using PowerPoint to create an insightful and visually engaging summary of key findings.

Summarize insights through Excel pivot tables, reinforcing Excel analysis skills.

Showcase work publicly on GitHub and Kaggle, with clear structure and supporting files.

Present the workflow through a clickable, interactive timeline—shared on LinkedIn—to guide viewers through each project stage.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
PostgreSQL – Table setup, data cleaning, and SQL queries

Kaggle – SQL notebook for querying and public visibility

Excel – Pivot tables for trend summaries

PowerPoint – Presentation of data insights and storytelling

GitHub – Project folder organization and version control

LinkedIn – Final interactive timeline shared for project walkthrough

📈 Key Questions Explored
Which borough collected the most refuse overall, and in which year or month?

How do organics, paper, and refuse waste types vary across boroughs?

Are there any patterns or spikes in collection volume across seasons or years?

🧭 Project Timeline (Interactive)
This project is accompanied by a clickable timeline, shared on LinkedIn, that highlights each phase of the project. Viewers can follow each milestone:
