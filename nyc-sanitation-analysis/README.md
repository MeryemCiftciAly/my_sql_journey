# NYC Sanitation Waste Analysis — Personal Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was inspired by a public dataset from the **[New York City Department of Sanitation]**(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DSNY-Monthly-Tonnage-Data/ebb7-mvp5/data_preview), which tracks monthly waste tonnage across boroughs and waste types over several years. As I explored the dataset, several questions sparked my curiosity, and I decided to develop a full mini-project around it.

This project allowed me to combine SQL practice with storytelling, data exploration, and public presentation using tools like PowerPoint and Excel.

## 🎯 Objectives

-  Refine SQL skills by exploring and querying a real-world dataset using PostgreSQL and Kaggle  
-  Practice data storytelling using PowerPoint to create an insightful and visually engaging summary  
-  Summarize insights through Excel pivot tables  
-  Showcase work publicly on GitHub and Kaggle  
- Present the workflow through a **clickable, interactive timeline** (shared on LinkedIn) that guides viewers through each project stage  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **PostgreSQL** – Table setup, data cleaning, and SQL queries  
- **Kaggle** – SQL notebook for querying and public visibility  
- **Excel** – Pivot tables for trend summaries  
- **PowerPoint** – Presentation of data insights and storytelling  
- **GitHub** – Project folder organization and version control  
- **LinkedIn** – Final interactive timeline shared for project walkthrough  

## Key Questions Explored

- Which borough collected the most refuse overall, and in which year or month?  
- How do organics, paper, and refuse waste types vary across boroughs?  
- Are there any patterns or spikes in collection volume across seasons or years?  

## 🧭 Project Timeline (Interactive)

This project is accompanied by a **clickable timeline**, shared on LinkedIn, that highlights each phase of the project. Viewers can follow each milestone:

1. **Data Download** – Source link and CSV file  
2. **SQL Table Setup & Cleaning** – PostgreSQL scripts and raw-to-cleaned structure  
3. **Querying in Kaggle** – Shared SQL notebook for public insight exploration  
4. **Pivot Table Summary** – Excel file highlighting major trends  
5. **Final Presentation** – PowerPoint slides with visual summary of findings  

Each timeline point links to the related GitHub folder, file, or notebook to make it easy for others to follow the journey.
