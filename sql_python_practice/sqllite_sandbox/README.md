# Python + SQL Sandbox (SQLite3)

This folder is my sandbox for practicing how **Python** and **SQL** work together.  
I’m using SQLite3 because it’s lightweight and file-based, making it easy to focus on learning the workflow:

- Create tables
- Insert data
- Update and delete rows
- Query results

## Purpose
- Build muscle memory for connecting Python ↔ SQL.
- Learn best practices for writing clean, modular Python scripts.
- Practice the same coding patterns I’ll later apply in PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and Databricks.

## Current Setup
- Scripts are stored in `scripts/` and cover basic database operations.
- No real datasets yet data is entered directly in SQL commands.
- No notebooks (Kaggle/Jupyter) for now, since focus is on coding correctly, not visualization.
