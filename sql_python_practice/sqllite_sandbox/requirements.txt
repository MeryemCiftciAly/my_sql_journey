# Libraries used (or planned to be used) in this Python + SQL sandbox

# SQLite3 is built into Python, no need to install separately
# But if I use other libraries for practice, I’ll list them here:

pandas       # For working with tabular data
openpyxl     # For Excel file reading/writing
sqlalchemy   # For higher-level SQL handling (optional practice)
